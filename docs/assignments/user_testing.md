## User Tests

### Erika 

First, I asked her to create an account, but she had some trouble due to confusion between the options of logging in and registering. I believe this was not a definitional but a positional issue. Because the form for registering a new user almost falls off the bottom of the page, it takes much less precedence in the user’s mind and leads them to the first option of login. Perhaps placing the two options side by side rather than on top of each other would remedy this issue. After she found the correct form she had no issues creating an account. She was easily able to find a post she would be interested in making, but when asked to rate the page she had a hard time determining that her rating went through, and ended up placing multiple ratings, adding a confirmation message could remedy this issue. When asked to create a stitch, she asked me what a stitch was, I realized that this is not defined anywhere in the interface, and is impossible for users to understand what one is. It is critical to add an explanation so users can understand the purpose of this key feature. She was able to make a post without difficulty. When asking her what frustrations she had when using the website, she mentioned how the entire website was “confusing to use”, when asked to elaborate she explained did not understand the features the website provided, and would not know where to get started if she was not guided by instructions. She was also confused about the difference between the meaning of blueprint and thumbnail in the creation of a post. In summary, she had a straightforward time using each individual feature of the website, but had a hard time understanding how to use them all together, and where to get started.

### Cassie

After asking her to create an account she was easily able to create one without trouble. She also easily located a craft she was interested in. When I asked her to rate it however, she asked me if 1 or 5 was the easiest. This could easily be confused by many users, as it is not inherently clear what a greater number means. This could be fixed by simply adding labels on each edge of the slider (‘easiest’ — ‘hardest’). She was able to comment and stitch without trouble, but she also asked me what a stitch was, further emphasizing the importance of an explanation for this feature. When asked to create a post, she was easily able to find the form, but she made a similar remark to Erika about being able to add more mediums/communities if your craft did not fit into one of the currently available ones. After successfully performing each instruction, she brought up that if there were many more posts it would be difficult to find what you are looking for, even with the community search option, suggesting a need for more in depth tags. She also suggested calling the section the ‘posts’ a ‘crafts’ section to further emphasize to the user the purpose. She suggested adding a profile feature which would allow users to create their own profiles with a photo and a small biography, although I think this would be outside the scope of immediate issues, it could add a valuable level of personalization to the website. I was happy to hear that she found the website very easy to use for the most part, unfortunately, this meant that most of her issues were conceptual. These issues such as purpose and definitions are critical to fix, as users cannot use the website without knowing what each feature does.

## Flaws
- Lack of instructions (Conceptual, Critical): Users may not know how to use much of the app, or what each part means
- Scaling (Conceptual, Major): Users may not know what a high or low number corresponds to in ratings
- Placement (Physical, Minor): Users could be confused by the placement of certian forms, where some will take precedent over others in ther mind, notably the login and register forms.
