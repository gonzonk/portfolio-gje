# Needfinding!

## Interview Planning

**Hunch:** In preliminary conversations, research, and consideration, I believe there may be a lack of a social media purpsoe built for crafters (Fiber art, Woodworking, etc.).

**Interviewees:** I plan to interview two long time crafters of different age groups: 
- My mother, an older crafter (mostly scrapbooking) who primarily uses facebook.
- My friend who is currently a med student, with a passion for fiber arts, who uses facebook, instagram, and reddit.

**Conversation Starters:**
- What types of crafts do you enjoy -> find out particular crafting interests
- When did you start \*your craft\*? -> evoke stories from interviewee
- Do you have any particular memories involving \*your craft\* that stand out to you? -> evoke stories from interviewee
- How did you get into \*your craft\*? -> evoke stories from interviewee
- How do you get inspiration for \*your craft\*? -> attempt to provoke responses pertaining to seeing crafts on social medias
- How do you like to recieve patterns/blueprints for \*your craft\*? -> attempt to find out what experience users want when finding crafts

## Interview Summary
### Cassie and Gabby (My Mom and Sister):
During this interview Gabby, who is also a crafter, happened to be around and I was fortunately able to interview both Cassie and Gabby at the same time. I opened with the basic question of asking each which types of crafts they did to warm up the conversation, they both had an interest in sewing and Cassie highlighted an interest in "miscellaneous crafting such as my merry christmas wood block". I then asked how each of them get inspiration for their crafts and I was suprised when they both mentioned pintrest as the main place they source their craft ideas adn Gabby included that she also finds many craft ideas on TikTok. When I asked them how like to recieve instructions for their crafts Gabby explained "I like my instructions to be in video form because I find written instructions difficult to understand". I pushed Gabby on whether or not she found the the written instructions useful at all and I was suprised how emphatic she was about their usefulness as a supplemental aide to a video tutorial. \
I then pivoted the interview to try and find points of friction in their use of pinterest to find craft ideas. I asked Gabby to walk me through how she finds a craft on pinterest. I was suprised when she explained she often searched for specific style and medium of craft and found that items outside of her search parameters would appear. When I asked her why this might be she suggested people innapropraitely tag their posts. She further lamented  "A majority of the things people post don't have tutorials, or any information how to do it, its just a picture of a craft‚Äù. At this point in the interview I revealed I was exploring the potential of a social media designed for crafters and wondered if either would be interested in sharing their crafts to a social media platform such as instagram, Cassie said she didnt like posting on social media but Gabby said she would be inclined to share her crafts to her close friends. Finally, when asking if either of them had any closing remarks, Cassondra suggested that "crafts display their approximate completion time" and Gabby suggested that "crafts include a difficulty level". They both agreed that a sorting and a rating system would imporve thier craftfinding expereice and were both adamant that scaled rating system would be more valuable to them than a like system.

## Design Opportunities
- Posts must incude either a video tutorial or written instructions, preferrably both. Alternatively posts could link to other posts whose instructions were followed to create the result. This feature will ensure users will be able to take crafts they like and make them at home. This will avoid the problems with apps like pinterest where many posts dont have tutorials
- Posts should have a difficulty rating out of a list of (begginer, easy, medium, hard, expert) as well an apporximate completion time. These design facets would allow users to determine at a glance whether they have the skill and time to complete a craft. This feature would prevent users from undertaking projects they would be unable to complete.
- Posts should have applicable tags. These tags should be sourced from a user generated database with user genrated descriptions. These tags will help in aid users in searching for crafts in specific mediums and styles. And easily accessible tag descriptions will improve the quality of tags provided on posts.
- Posts should be able to be rated on a scale from 1 - 5 and should display average user ratings at a glance. Furthermore search results should be able to be sorted by average rating. This feature will allow users to find the best crafts fitting certain tags as determined by other users.
