# Cassondra with Guest Appearance of Gabby:
Mother said they do sewing, scrapbooking, some basketweaving, and "miscellaneous crafting
such as my merry christmas wood block". Gabby knitting and crocheting and sewing. ‘Lately i
have been finding crafts on social media like pinterest ‘Fabric christmas gift bag w/ drawstring,
fabric pinwheel ornaments, christmas block woodworked’’’ Gabby: find inspiration for crafts on
tiktok and instagram. Bad algorithm and **bad tagging system**. Both Gabby and Mother said
they find it hard to pursue crafts as many don't have links. Gabby says "A majority of the things
people post don't have tutorials, or any information how to do it, its just a picture of a craft”
‘sometimes tik tok better’, ‘often a couple seconds of item then tutorial’, ‘multiple part tutorials on
tiktok. “I like my tutorials to be in video format because i find the written instructions difficult to
understand”’. Mother said ‘I also like video tutorials, where each step is thoroughly explained.”’
Both said ‘supplemental resources are helpful’ mother: ‘especially if there are measurements’.
WOuld you post a craft ‘i post an instagram on my spam’ mom ‘i don't post on social media’.
Gabby mentioned people inappropriately tag posts. Mother ‘i like to create something that would
be useful to me or someone else’ both also enjoy ‘the process of making the craft. Helpful
feature recommendation ‘difficulty categories’. When asked for closing remarks Gabby if the
could ‘easy, medium, hard’. *Sort by most popular ‘pinterest no sort’. Mom suggested an
approximate times. Both said they prefer rating system out of 5 stars over like system.*
# Erika
Said she was a fiber artist. ‘I think i was always into crafting’ had a little pottery kit when young,
needle pointed alot when young, knitted at 6 or 7, rainbow loom. Grandma taught her how to
knit. Mentioned finding inspiration on youtube. Said "I prefer videos as my primary resource for
fiber arts projects". Somem yarn comes with patterns on the back. Contradiction about writted
instructions she says "I prefer written patterns for easy difficulty crafts, but I like to have video
support for harder crafts" Now she also browses on instagram. Sometimes youtube videos can
be blurry or have unclear instructions. Suggested, a comments section that is more like a q&a or
a way to message the pattern creator to clear up difficulties. A lot of difficulties on instagram,
video limits, often have to pay for the pattern or unclear. A Lot of guessing when the tutorial is
only 60 seconds instagram time limit. ‘"often unclear what materials the person used, because
they are not shown or written in the description,". “Individual designers have blogs preferred,
have a lot of written instructions” and clarity. Mentioned ravelry, a website for patterns, but said
many of them cost money, also mentioned finding patterns on etsy which are also paid.Said a
lot of designers support themselves with affiliate links to yarn and such. Important features to
her: “free high quality patterns, video supported tutorials, a way to engage with other makers,
and a way to post crafts to see how others made a certain pattern.
